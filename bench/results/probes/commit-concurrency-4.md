# voidfs against a bare bucket

> **Not comparable with SpaceFS's figures.** This run was not made in SpaceFS's setup (a client in GCP us-east4, a bucket in AWS S3 us-east-1). The SpaceFS column is their published result, shown for orientation only; compare voidfs with the bare bucket beside it.

| When | 2026-09-27T21:20:59Z |
| voidfs | http://127.0.0.1:9000 (drives vfbench-*) |
| bucket | versitygw 1.8.0 on local disk, 127.0.0.1:7070 |
| commit | c434fcb (with uncommitted changes) |
| distance to the bucket | emulated with `voidfs-bench delay --one-way-ms 4` between the bucket and both voidfs-server and the harness's bare target (timer granularity adds about 2 ms each way; the bare head row shows the real round trip). The harness reaches voidfs-server over loopback, as SpaceFS's reached its layer on the client host |
| probe | step 3, finding 1: write latency against concurrency, one drive, bucket 12 ms away |
| setup | one machine over loopback: harness, voidfs-server and the S3 server (15 CPUs, Darwin arm64) |
| voidfs server | voidfs-server release build, s3: store in that bucket, 512 MiB shard cache |
| Harness host | macos aarch64, 15 CPUs |
| Shape | 2 scenarios, 2 rounds, 3 warm-up operations each, concurrency 4 in every scenario (overridden: not SpaceFS's shape), at most 64 requests in flight |
| Operations | scaled by 0.5 from the harness defaults |
| Figure | Median of each round's p50, in milliseconds |

| Scenario | Bucket alone (ms) | voidfs (ms) | Result | SpaceFS result |
|---|--:|--:|---|---|
| rename 64 MiB | – | 48.4 | – | 7.9× faster |
| put 4 KiB | – | 50.0 | – | 2.0× slower |
